# Webscraping and Visualization of Job Market Websites

This is the project aims to find information of job market among Latin America and Caribbean countries.

This work is done through my participation in the **C^2 lab** at the University of California, Davis, headed by **Prof. Martin Hilbert**.

While working in this lab, I discovered the Jupyter Notebook and several data analysis techiques.
I implemented a web-based visualization using **d3.js v3** for visualizations. The webpage is implemented based on **Python-Flask**.
I used matplotlib along with numpy and pandas to create analytic results and visulizations.

The code of the webpage could be found under **web** folder.

I also implemented web scrapers using **BeautifulSoup4** and **Selenium**. The target website is: [https://www.workana.com/en/freelancers](https://www.workana.com/en/freelancers)

The scraper using BeautifulSoup4 is available under **scrap/bs4**.
The scraper using Selenium is available under **scrap/selenium**.
