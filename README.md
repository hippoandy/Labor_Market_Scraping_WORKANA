# UN_Webscraping_WORKANA

This is the project aims to find information of job market among Latin America and Caribbean countries.

This work is done through my participation in the **C^2 lab** at the University of California, Davis, headed by **Prof. Martin Hilbert**.

While working in this lab, I discovered the Jupyter Notebook and several data analysis techiques.
I implemented a web-based visualization using d3.js v3 for visualizations. The webpage is implemented based on Python-Flask.
I used matplotlib along with numpy and pandas to create analytic results and visulizations.
